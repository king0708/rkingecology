# Project Overview 

There are many threatened and endangered species within California drylands, and 
many active efforts to conserve and restore their populations. One important component
of conservation for endangered consumers, such as the Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard, 
is ensuring that they have adequate prey resources. In this project, we compiled 
a list of prey of endangered species in California drylands, downloaded occurrence
 records for the prey from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](www.gbif.org), and used these to create species distribution models for finding suitable prey 
 habitat. These were stacked to identify hot-spots of potential prey species
richness for different predators. These species distribution models, raw occurrence records, and other summary plots can be viewed interactively in the linked 
[shiny app](https://kingr.shinyapps.io/Prey_map_shiny/). The data for the app and
associated paper (King et al., *submitted*) are availble on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/10215172](https://zenodo.org/records/10215172).
