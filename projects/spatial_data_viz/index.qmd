# Workshop Overview

My first workshop for [EcoDataScience](https://ecodatascience.github.io/) on [visualizing spatial data](https://king0708.github.io/spatial-data-viz/). I present an overview of the `sf` package in R, how to add a basemap with different packages, and some other tips and tricks for improving reproducibility and efficiency in map making.
