    "text": "My research in ecosystem ecology has focused on both carbon and nitrogen cycling, primarily in northern temperate forests.\nLitter Decomposition in a Changing Climate\nThis study explored multiple impacts of climate change on leaf litter decomposition in a unique global change experiment, Boreal Forest Warming at an Ecotone in Danger. We found that both rainfall reduction and warming resulted in slower decomposition but rainfall reduction had a stronger effect. Growing leaf litter under warmed conditions also shifted decomposition rates in unexpected ways.\nUsing Plant Traits to Understand Nitrogen Acquisition\n“In many ecosystems, nitrogen (N) is the predominant nutrient limiting plant growth. Plants have therefore developed diverse strategies to compete for and partition soil N resources to ensure an adequate N supply. Differences in how plants acquire N may be important for predicting plant responses to different global changes. In particular, how species respond to climate change may depend on their N use strategy since climate change will likely alter the forms of N available to plants as well as total N availability. However, there remain key gaps in our understanding of plant N acquisition that impede our ability to project the impacts of climate change on plant communities. My research focuses on one of these gaps, the variation in plant use of different chemical forms of N, and examines how that variation can influence plant responses to climate change. Specifically, my research aims to increase our understanding of N acquisition in trees by examining whether plant traits can improve our ability to identify and explain differences in the use of different N forms.”\n\n\n\nTree Diversity and Survival\nThis project examined how tree species richness influenced sapling survival in a reforestation experiment, BiodiversiTREE, to offer insight into how to craft more successful tree plantings for future reforestation efforts.\nTree Diversity Impacts on Soil Carbon Storage\nReforestation efforts are often touted as having the potential to sequester carbon, but frequently focus solely on aboveground pools of carbon. This project focuses on understanding how different aspects of tree diversity influenced soil carbon storage in the early stages of a reforestation effort.\n\n\n\nUsing SSDMs to Understand Distributions of Prey Items for Endangered Species\nSpecies distribution models are a common tool for conservation practioners. Here we explore how stacked-SDMs for prey of threatened and endangered species can be used to help identify priority areas for conservation.\nImproving Biodiversity Monitoring Through Conservation Technology\nSuccessful conservation relies on assessing and monitoring the outcomes of actions taken to protect species as well as understanding the status of species populations. Conservation technology has the potential to improve our capacity to monitor biodiversity, yet it’s potential far exceeds it’s implementation. At NCEAS I am working to understand both the current scope of automated biodiversity monitoring and ways to improve our capacity to monitor with these technologies through working groups and collaborative research."

I enjoy the challenge and insights that come from thinking about big questions in ecology and leveraging existing data to further our understanding of important topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning\nI am continuously fascinated by the diversity of life on Earth and how different organisms interact to perform key ecosystem functions. My work in this area has recently focused on how tree diversity impacts tree survival and carbon storage in a tree diversity experiment, investigating the impacts of climate change on leaf litter decomposition, and identifying gaps and improvement opportunities in automated biodiversity monitoring."

    "text": "Project Overview\nThere are many threatened and endangered species within California drylands, and many active efforts to conserve and restore their populations. One important component of conservation for endangered consumers, such as the Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard, is ensuring that they have adequate prey resources. In this project, we compiled a list of prey of endangered species in California drylands, downloaded occurrence records for the prey from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and used these to create species distribution models for finding suitable prey habitat. These were stacked to identify hot-spots of potential prey species richness for different predators. These species distribution models, raw occurrence records, and other summary plots can be viewed interactively in the linked shiny app. The data for the app and associated paper (King et al., submitted) are availble on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10215172.\n\n\nThe first page of the Shiny application."
