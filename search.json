I enjoy the challenge and insights that come from thinking about big questions in ecology and leveraging existing data to further our understanding of important topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning\nI am continuously fascinated by the diversity of life on Earth and how different organisms interact to perform key ecosystem functions. My work in this area has recently focused on how tree diversity impacts tree survival and carbon storage in a tree diversity experiment, investigating the impacts of climate change on leaf litter decomposition, and identifying gaps and improvement opportunities in automated biodiversity monitoring."

    "text": "Project Overview\nThere are many threatened and endangered species within California drylands, and many active efforts to conserve and restore their populations. One important component of conservation for endangered consumers, such as the Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard, is ensuring that they have adequate prey resources. In this project, we compiled a list of prey of endangered species in California drylands, downloaded occurrence records for the prey from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and used these to create species distribution models for finding suitable prey habitat. These were stacked to identify hot-spots of potential prey species richness for different predators. These species distribution models, raw occurrence records, and other summary plots can be viewed interactively in the linked shiny app. The data for the app and associated paper (King et al., submitted) are availble on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10215172.\n\n\nThe first page of the Shiny application."
